                    I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science and International Development at the University of Guelph, Canada. I am a specialist in global governance and public policy, feminist methods and gender mainstreaming.

                    My current project explores the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the usefulness of its gender equality commitments for development actors in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. I explore how this global framework translates to national agendas and impacts gender equality efforts of the UN and donor agencies, academia, media, civil society organizations, and national governments.
                    
                    This research was made possible by the Ontario Trillium Foundation, the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC) and the Ala.stair Summerlee Fund.
                    
                    Prior to my PhD, I completed my studies at La Sapienza University of Rome and Roma Tre University. I also had the opportunity to work for the UN’s World Food Programme in development and emergency preparedness contexts.
                    
                    I am currently working on data analysis and dissemination, consulting on policy and development projects, and teaching university-level courses on global gender justice.

                        Research Project <br>

                        My primary research project examines the usefulness of gender commitments expressed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Agenda 2030 is the first international development framework elaborated in consultation with 192 member states of the United Nations, informing efforts of state and non-state actors for the upcoming 10 years.

                        Throughout this policy evaluation, I focus on the way gender commitments of Agenda 2030, expressed across its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, are impacting efforts towards gender equality in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.

                    <p>
                        Approach <br>

                        I believe that international development policies impact and are impacted by the entirety of the international development system interacting across a set of diverging power dynamics. Rather than a sum of institutional policy initiatives, Agenda 2030’s integration in national contexts is a result of continuous negotiation between national and international priorities and complex relationships among development actors.   

                        With this in mind, my research looks at the way Agenda 2030 has been integrated by (i) development partners – donor agencies, (ii) United Nations (UN) agencies, (iii) international and national civil society organizations, (iv) national governments, (v) media, (vi) academia, and (vii) private sector foundations.

                        Comparative appreciative inquiry <br>
                        To promote regional learning, highlight good practices, and identify common bottlenecks, this research project specifically focuses on the way Agenda 2030’s gender commitments are employed in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. These three countries are integrating the same global, regional, and sub-regional policies and have taken impressive initiatives towards the elaboration and later integration of Agenda 2030.

                        Policy dialogues <br>
                        To contribute to efforts of bridging the gap between policy research and practice, this research is structured as a policy dialogue in its data collection and knowledge mobilization components. <br>

                        A combination of academic articles, blog posts, policy briefs, and workshop proceedings reports will be employed to disseminate data collected over 100 interviews, focus group discussions, and participatory workshops. The goal is to strengthen policy recommendations with systematic academic research and inform global governance and feminist theories with insight from diverse development specialists who have generously dedicated their time and expertise to this project.

                        Teaching <br>

                        My approach to teaching is one focused on empowering students to explore complex concepts and directly apply them to their critical reflections around their everyday lives and contemporary social phenomena. My syllabi are structured to (i) challenge dominant narratives and encourage critical thinking, (ii) allow for creative expressions and learning preferences of a diverse group of students, (iii) develop students’ employable skills, (iv) encourage peer-to-peer collaboration, and (v) amplify voices of thinkers working on the margins of dominant theory spheres. <br>
                        
                        I have designed an intensive graduate Feminist Studies course and an inter-disciplinary course on social justice aiming at first-year college students. I have also designed and taught a third-year course on Global Gender Justice. Lastly, in collaboration with a PhD candidate from the engineering program, Colin Gibson, I designed and led a first-year seminar course on environmental activism.

                        POLS3160 Global Gender Justice 
                        This course delves into debates on the intersection between feminist studies and international development. Designed as a combination of interactive lectures and seminar sessions, students examine fundamental questions of gender, social justice, and structural oppression. Linking to broader debates around globalization, ethnocentrism, and imperialism, this course is grounded in feminist political thought, encompassing multimedia content by artists and scholars around the globe. 
                        Students are asked to draw reflexive analysis linking course concepts to their understanding of society through (i) lecture reflections, (ii) feminist co-learning efforts, (iii) course diaries, (iv) analytical reading overviews, and (v) Wikipedia Edit-a-Thons.

                        POLS6800 Core Course in Political Feminist Theory
                        This graduate course is oriented towards students focusing on feminist studies. Based on feminist-co teaching, this course allows students to elaborate their interpretations of core feminist theory readings. The course also guides students through theoretical and practical implications of feminist methodology and introduces them to systematic literature review process. Building on the notion of feminist solidarity, the course builds on past experience of guest lecturers who are early career feminist scholars.

                        UNIV1000 Avoiding the Apocalypse: Global Environmental Activism and Social Change 
                        This interdisciplinary first-year seminar aims to equip students with theoretical and strategic instruments needed to understand (i) technical issues at the core of environmental movements, (ii) theoretical concepts of social justice, and (ii) strategic tools of social movement organization and participation. Students are introduced to social change and social movement theories as well as strategies of power mapping, campaign management, and strategic popular mobilization. This course strengthens students’ skills of collaboration and self-expression through creative assessments such as podcast and blog creation, policy advocacy campaigns etc.

                    Mapping Gender and SDG Synergies – Workshop Proceedings Reports
                    Under the sponsorship of the International Development Research Centre of Canada (IDRC), I organized participatory workshops that gathered my research participants from national state institutions, academia, civil society, and UN organizations to collectively discuss further steps needed for greater synergies between gender equality agenda and SDG implementation efforts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    These reports present preliminary findings on national SDG domestication processes but also a mapping of in-country actors working in this area. A set of jointly elaborated recommendations directed at various national and international institutions makes these reports forward-looking and actionable.
